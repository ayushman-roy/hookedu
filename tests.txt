FIXED: SequelizeUniqueConstraintError: 
when update data on pre_register_post from pre-user exists
happens even when data in database changes sucessfully
if unique:true disabled in model, multiple entries happen
more debugging needed
high suspect: the user != null not evaluated and direct newuser made

FIXED: ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT:
cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
something to do with .redirect(500, "back") in the error blocks
