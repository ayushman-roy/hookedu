Instruction to run the front end react  on your device:
Step 1 : npm create-react-app frontend1
Step 2:  CD frontend1
Step 3:  npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
step 4: Delete the default 'src' and 'public'  file and copy paste the file I have pushed on git.
Step 5: npm start

Inside src/pages I have created Login page(login.jsx) & Registration.jsx.
Have not customized it according to backend yet (sorry for being slow) .
